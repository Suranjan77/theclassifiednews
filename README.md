## Summary
<p>Text classification is the task of classifying textual document into predefined categories.</p><br>
<p>Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is used to classify news articles into predefined
categories. Textual news data is preprocessed and classified using the Naive Bayes algorithm </p><br>
<p>Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm performed well in the five categories: politics,
business, sports, technology and entertainment. The algorithm was able to perform with
accuracy of 98 %, 98%, 99%, 97% and 95% on politics, business, sports, technology and
entertainment respectively. The algorithm was able to classify the documents faster after
performing dimensionality reduction using chi square method on input textual document.</p>
